# Learning-iOS-Programming-with-Swift

I'm a college CS student in China since 2015/9. Last term, I was tend to learn iOS developing and I found there were two languages: Objective-C and Swift. After consideration, I decided to learn Swift and use it in iOS programming cause it's light and powerful.<br>
Here, I'm going to keep updating my experience and and little demo projects and fixing them in time on my learning iOS Programming with Swift.<br>
